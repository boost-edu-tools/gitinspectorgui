# AI Development Ecosystem

This guide outlines the AI-powered development tools and workflows used for GitInspectorGUI development, helping you choose the right tool for each task.

## Available Tools

### Claude.ai - Research & Analysis

**When to use:** Research, documentation analysis, exploring new technologies

-   **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic API)
-   **Key capabilities:** File upload analysis, web search, current information access
-   **Best for:** Understanding complex codebases, researching best practices

### Cline (VSCode) - Primary Development

**When to use:** Most coding tasks, file modifications, debugging

-   **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (OpenRouter API)
-   **Key capabilities:** Direct file system access, reliable execution, minimal setup
-   **Best for:** Writing code, fixing bugs, implementing features, refactoring

### Roo Code (VSCode) - System Architecture

**When to use:** Complex system design, multi-component coordination

-   **Model:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (OpenRouter API)
-   **Key capabilities:** Multi-agent workflows, orchestrated development
-   **Best for:** Planning large features, system architecture, coordinating multiple components

### GitHub Copilot - Inline Assistance

**When to use:** Quick single-line improvements, code completion

-   **Key capability:** Inline editor improvements (Ctrl+I, macOS: Command+I)
-   **Best for:** Small edits, code suggestions, completing patterns

## Tool Selection Strategy

### Start with Cline

Cline should be your **first choice** for most development tasks due to its reliability and direct file system access.

### Escalate to Claude.ai when:

-   Cline lacks current information about technologies
-   Research is needed before implementation
-   Cline repeatedly fails to solve a complex problem

### Use Roo Code only when:

-   Planning complex system architecture
-   Coordinating multiple components or services
-   Managing large-scale refactoring across many files

### Use Copilot for:

-   Quick inline code improvements
-   Auto-completion while typing
-   Single-line fixes and enhancements

## Recommended Workflows

### Standard Development Flow

1. **Plan** - Use Cline to understand requirements and plan approach
2. **Implement** - Use Cline for coding and file modifications
3. **Polish** - Use Copilot (Ctrl+I) for inline improvements
4. **Commit** - Clean up and commit when feature is complete

### Research-Heavy Development

1. **Research** (Claude.ai) - Upload files, research technologies, generate guidelines
2. **Document** - Save research findings as markdown reference
3. **Implement** (Cline) - Code using research as guidance
4. **Refine** (Copilot) - Polish with inline improvements

### Complex Architecture Projects

1. **Design** (Roo Code) - Plan system architecture and component interactions
2. **Document** - Create architecture documentation
3. **Implement** (Cline) - Build individual components
4. **Integrate** (Cline/Roo Code) - Coordinate component integration

## Best Practices

### Version Control

-   **Use checkpoints over frequent commits** - Let AI tools create checkpoints, commit when features are ready
-   **Maintain clean git history** - Avoid micro-commits from AI iterations

### Quality Assurance

-   **Review AI suggestions** - Always understand and verify AI-generated code
-   **Test incrementally** - Test changes as you build, don't wait until the end
-   **Use multiple perspectives** - Switch tools if one approach isn't working
