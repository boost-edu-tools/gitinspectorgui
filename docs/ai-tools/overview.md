# AI-Powered Development Ecosystem

## Overview

The GitInspectorGUI project utilizes a carefully selected ecosystem of AI tools that collectively provide the best available AI-assisted development experience in 2025. This documentation covers our recommended workflow combining three complementary tools, each optimized for specific aspects of software development.

## The Three-Tool Ecosystem

### 1. Claude.ai - Research and Analysis Hub

-   **Purpose:** Strategic research, documentation analysis, web-based information gathering
-   **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 (via Anthropic API)
-   **Best for:** Complex research tasks supported by analysis of uploaded files, content generation with web search

### 2. VSCode with Roo Code - Advanced Development

-   **Purpose:** Complex architecture, multi-agent workflows, specialized development modes
-   **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 (via OpenRouter API)
-   **Best for:** Large projects, system architecture, orchestrated development tasks

### 3. VSCode with Cline - Direct Development

-   **Purpose:** Direct coding, immediate file modifications, single-agent tasks
-   **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 (via OpenRouter API)
-   **Best for:** Relatively quick file edits, debugging, straightforward development tasks

## Why This Combination Works

**Complementary Strengths:**

-   **Claude.ai** excels at research and provides web search capabilities that VSCode extensions lack
-   **Roo Code** offers specialized modes and multi-agent orchestration for complex projects
-   **Cline** provides reliable, direct development assistance with minimal setup

**Cost Optimization:**

-   Pricing for Claude Sonnet 4 starts at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens
-   OpenRouter provides access to the same models at competitive rates
-   Strategic tool selection based on task complexity can in principle minimize token usage

## Tool Selection Guide

### Use Claude.ai when:

-   Researching current technologies or best practices
-   Analyzing multiple uploaded files for insights
-   Generating research-backed content or documentation
-   Needing web search integration for current information
-   Working on tasks not directly tied to your codebase

### Use Roo Code when:

-   Planning complex architecture or system design
-   Managing large, multi-component projects
-   Needing specialized modes (Architect, Debug, Orchestrator)
-   Requiring browser automation or advanced customization

### Use Cline when:

-   Making direct, possibly plan supported, code changes
-   Working with relatively simple, reliable development tasks
-   Preferring a streamlined, straightforward assistant

## Checkpoint Strategy in Roo Code and Cline

**Use checkpoints instead of frequent commits:**

-   Roo / Cline create a checkpoint after each change
-   User asks for commit when necessary

**Benefits:**

-   Clean git history
-   Easy rollback options: user can revert to each checkpoint

## Response Style Optimization in Roo Code and Cline

**Problem:** Verbose completion summaries

Roo Code and Cline have a tendency to provide extremely detailed completion
summaries. What is even worse is that after each minor additional action related to the
completed task(s), the complete summary is repeated including the minor
addtional action.

Asking Cline or Roo Code not to do this, helps for a short time, but after each
reload of VSCode, the behavior resets.

**Solution**

Apart from temporary solutions, a permanent proper solution is unclear.

### Combining Claude.ai with Roo Code or CLine

**Problem**

-   Claude.ai excels at web-based supported research
-   Roo Code and Cline excel at editing project files, but are very limited in
    web-based search

We often need both.

**Solution**

#### 1. Research Phase (Claude.ai)

-   Enter you prompt question and if needed, add relevant files for analysis to
    the the prompt by uploading them
-   Research current best practices and technologies
-   Create comprehensive output for implementation

#### 2. Implementation Phase (Local Development)

-   Save Claude.ai research output as an markdown reference file
-   Switch to VSCode with Roo Code or Cline
-   Instruct Roo or Cline to use the markdown reference file in the required (re)design

## Documentation Structure

-   **[Roo Code Development Guide](roo-code-guide.md)** - Multi-agent architecture and advanced features
-   **[Cline Development Guide](cline-guide.md)** - Direct coding assistance and troubleshooting
