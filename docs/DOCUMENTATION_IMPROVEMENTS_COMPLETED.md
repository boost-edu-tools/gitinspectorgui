# Documentation Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive documentation improvements for GitInspectorGUI, addressing consistency, duplication, organization, and readability issues as outlined in the approved implementation plan.

## Completed Changes

### Phase 1: Foundation & Standards ✅

#### Navigation Standardization

-   **Updated `mkdocs.yml`** with consistent naming patterns and logical organization
-   **Removed inconsistencies** like "CLI Usage" vs "CLI Standalone"
-   **Standardized naming** to "CLI Guide", "Development Workflow", "Package Management"
-   **Created logical hierarchy** with "Advanced" subdirectory for specialized content

#### Cross-Reference Standards
