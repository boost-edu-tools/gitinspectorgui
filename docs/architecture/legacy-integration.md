# Legacy Analysis Integration

## Overview

This document describes the current integration of sophisticated git analysis algorithms from `gitinspectorgui-old` into the modern Tauri-based GitInspectorGUI architecture.

## Integration Architecture

### Current Implementation

The system now integrates the sophisticated legacy analysis engine with the modern Tauri frontend:

-   **Location**: `gitinspectorgui/python/gigui/`
-   **Integration**: Legacy analysis algorithms integrated via `legacy_engine.py`
-   **Capabilities**:
    -   Advanced person identity merging
    -   Comprehensive statistics calculation
    -   Integrated blame analysis
    -   Advanced filtering capabilities
    -   Performance-optimized git operations

### Legacy Engine Components

The integrated components from `gitinspectorgui-old` include:

-   **Person Identity Management** (`person_data.py`): Advanced author name normalization and identity merging
-   **Statistics Engine** (`data.py`): Comprehensive metrics calculation and aggregation
-   **Repository Analysis** (`repo_data.py`): Complete analysis workflow orchestration
-   **Blame Analysis** (`repo_blame.py`): Line-by-line attribution and historical tracking
-   **Performance Optimizations**: Optimized git operations and data structures

        I --> J[data.py - Statistics Engine]
        J --> K[repo_blame.py - Blame Analysis]
        K --> L[Structured Results]
    end

    B --> E
    L --> C
```

## Dependency Management

### uv + pyproject.toml Architecture

The integration uses **uv** with **pyproject.toml** for dependency management, providing:

#### Key Benefits

-   **Performance**: uv is significantly faster than pip for dependency resolution
-   **Modern tooling**: Future-proof Python package management
-   **Consistency**: Matches existing gitinspectorgui-old project structure
-   **Better resolution**: Superior dependency conflict resolution compared to pip

#### Current Commands

-   `uv add <package>` - Add new dependencies
-   `uv sync` - Install/sync all dependencies from pyproject.toml
-   `uv run <command>` - Execute scripts in the uv environment
-   `uv remove <package>` - Remove dependencies

## Current Implementation

### Integrated Components

#### Core Data Structures

-   **Type System**: Enhanced type definitions from legacy codebase
-   **Person Identity Management**: Advanced author name normalization and identity merging
-   **Statistics Engine**: Comprehensive metrics calculation with `Stat`, `CommitGroup`, and `PersonStat` classes

#### Analysis Engine

-   **Git Operations Layer**: Optimized git command execution with error handling and performance monitoring
-   **Blame Analysis**: Line-by-line attribution and historical blame tracking with performance optimizations
-   **Analysis Orchestrator**: Complete analysis workflow with statistics generation and result aggregation

#### Integration Layer

-   **Legacy Engine Wrapper**: Bridge between current API and legacy analysis with settings translation and result format conversion
-   **API Integration**: Enhanced API with legacy engine calls while maintaining existing contract

### Current File Structure

```
gitinspectorgui/python/gigui/
├── __init__.py
├── api.py                 # Main API (refactored)
├── typedefs.py           # Enhanced type definitions
├── legacy_engine.py      # Legacy analysis wrapper (new)
├── person_data.py        # Person identity management (new)
├── data.py              # Statistics engine (new)
├── repo_base.py         # Git operations layer (new)
├── repo_blame.py        # Blame analysis (new)
├── repo_data.py         # Main analysis orchestrator (new)
├── utils.py             # Utility functions (new)
└── cli.py               # CLI interface (existing)
```

### Dependency Management

The integration will maintain the modern uv + pyproject.toml approach:

```toml
# pyproject.toml structure (enhanced from gitinspectorgui-old)
[project]
name = "gitinspectorgui"
dependencies = [
    # Core dependencies from legacy codebase
    # Additional dependencies as needed
]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    # Development and testing dependencies
]
```

**Migration Commands**:

-   `uv sync` - Install all dependencies after integration
-   `uv add <package>` - Add any missing legacy dependencies
-   `uv run python -m gigui.api` - Execute analysis engine

### Data Flow Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant L as Legacy Engine
    participant R as Repo Data
    participant P as Person DB
    participant S as Statistics

    F->>A: execute_analysis(settings)
    A->>L: analyze_repository(settings)
    L->>R: RepoData.run_analysis()
    R->>P: PersonsDB.process_authors()
    P->>S: StatTables.calculate()
    S->>R: return statistics
    R->>L: return repo_results
    L->>A: return formatted_results
    A->>F: return AnalysisResult
```

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Settings Translation

```python
# In legacy_engine.py
def translate_settings(gui_settings: Settings) -> Args:
    """Convert GUI settings to legacy Args format"""
    return Args(
        input_fstrs=gui_settings.input_fstrs,
        depth=gui_settings.depth,
        ex_authors=gui_settings.ex_authors,
        # ... map all settings
    )
```

#### 2. Result Format Conversion

```python
# In legacy_engine.py
def convert_results(repo_data: RepoData) -> RepositoryResult:
    """Convert legacy results to GUI format"""
    authors = []
    for author, pstat in repo_data.author2pstat.items():
        if author != "*":  # Exclude totals
            authors.append(AuthorStat(
                name=pstat.person.author,
                email=list(pstat.person.emails)[0],
                commits=len(pstat.stat.shas),
                insertions=pstat.stat.insertions,
                deletions=pstat.stat.deletions,
                files=len(pstat.fstrs),
                percentage=pstat.stat.percent_insertions,
                age=pstat.stat.age
            ))
    return RepositoryResult(...)
```
