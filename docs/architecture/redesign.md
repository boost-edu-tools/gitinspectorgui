# Full-stack Architecture?

Recommend tools and technologies to develop a full-stack desktop app with the following characteristics:

-   Always single user only with single front end GUI.
-   Backend: Python using multithreading and multiprocessing.
-   For front-end to backend communication, I use both short lived Python processes and python processes that need to be kept alive and active.
-   CLI and GUI with almost identical settings (options): they share the same JSON settings file. I know and use JSON and jsonschema.
-   GUI should be a single page with: Settings with some 50 checkboxes/input boxes etc, Output with several tables, and an Execute button. Clicking the Execute button calls the Python backend and generates output for several repositories (depending on how many are found in a folder) and generates per repository a large number of complex output tables with blame analysis and changes analysis and a clickable list per repository that changes the root commit per table. Changing any setting should rerun python and update the output tables in place.
-   Output tables interactivity: usual column filtering as in Excel, with in addition toggle button to remove comment lines in blame output + automatic row height extension when hovering on long strings that do not fit in a single line Row. Further additions to come.
-   I am used to progamming UIs, such as in PySimpleGUI and JSX looks intuitive to me. I want to do rapid visual prototpying using the Flowbite Figma UI Kit (Free Edition). I do not want to use code generators from Figma to React.
-   I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript and I like shadcn/ui and Zustand.
-   CLI input is done via argparse, using almost identical inputs as via the GUI. Output of CLI and GUI is identical.
-   CLI does one Execute run and terminates. GUI can do multiple Execute runs and updates output tables in place.
-   If app depends on a browser, it should work with modern system browsers. Compatibility with old systems is not an issue. I prefer to avoid the use of (localhost) servers.
-   Single file app generation for desktop only, no touch, no mobile, should be possible for Windows and macOS (Arm + Intel) and hopefully, but not absolutely necessary for Linux.
-   For GUI app distribution, I want to use a technology that supports automatic, or user approved updating, without requiring the user to download and install each update.
-   For CLI app distribution, preferably the same technology and the same dynamic html tables output, but no settings input. These will be taken from the JSON settings file, with override settings via CLI arguments. GUI can also be started via CLI command.
-   I would like to have additional distribution via PyPI. For that I use uv with pyproject.toml.
-   Users tend to be academic teachers. Developers would be computer science students and academic teacher(s) (not necessarily from Computer Science).
-   I would prefer to use templates and libraries as much as possible, minimizing the code to write. Using various technologies is not a problem if they facilitate minimal code writing. Code writing the Python core is not a problem.
-   I want the design process and tools to be very well suited to AI supported code generation.
-   I want the (AI generated) architecture and code to be robust, relatively small, and easy to maintain.
-   Do not give code fragments.

# Answer

Based on your detailed requirements, here's a technology and tooling stack that best matches your preferences for developing a robust, AI-supportable, full-stack desktop app:

------

## üîß **Core Technologies**

### üñ•Ô∏è **Frontend (GUI)**

- **Framework**: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
  - Lightweight, secure, native-feel apps.
  - Uses system webview (no embedded Chromium).
  - Perfect for desktop-only, single-user apps.
  - Easily supports auto-updates via [`tauri-updater`](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/).
- **Language**: TypeScript
  - Matches your preference.
- **UI Framework**:
  - **React** (with JSX): Intuitive for you.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Used by Flowbite and shadcn/ui.
  - **shadcn/ui**: Great design system with Tailwind support.
  - **Flowbite React** (optional): For rapid prototyping, mapped from Flowbite Figma kit.
- **State Management**: Zustand
  - Minimal, easy to use, great for managing UI settings and backend status.
- **Tables**:
  - **TanStack Table (React Table)**: Advanced filtering, virtual scrolling, expandable rows.
  - **react-virtualized-auto-sizer**: For automatic row sizing on hover.

------

### üêç **Backend (Python)**

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
  - Native support for `concurrent.futures`, `asyncio`, `multiprocessing`, and `threading`.
- **CLI**:
  - Use `argparse` (already your choice).
  - Maintain full parity with GUI using shared JSON config schema.
- **GUI Integration**:
  - Use `tauri-plugin-shell` for short-lived Python calls.
  - Use `tauri-plugin-process` or `child_process` via Rust for long-running Python daemons.
  - Consider a lightweight JSON-RPC protocol over stdio or pipes for long-running interactions.
- **Shared JSON Settings**:
  - Use `jsonschema` for validation.
  - Synchronize between CLI and GUI.
- **Output Format**:
  - Use structured JSON output from Python backend.
  - React frontend reads and displays JSON in tables.

------

## üß± **App Architecture & Communication**

- **Frontend ‚Üî Backend Communication**:
  - **Short-lived**: Call Python scripts using `Command` API from Tauri or `tauri-plugin-shell`.
  - **Persistent**: Keep Python subprocess alive, communicate via stdio or named pipes. Use a lightweight protocol like JSON-RPC or custom newline-delimited JSON.
- **Shared Logic**:
  - Store settings in a versioned JSON file.
  - CLI parses it and overrides via `argparse`.
  - GUI loads and modifies it via Zustand UI bindings.

------

## üöÄ **Distribution & Updates**

- **Desktop Packaging**:
  - **Tauri**: Produces single-file apps for Windows/macOS (Arm+Intel) and Linux.
- **Automatic Updates**:
  - Use [Tauri Updater](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater/) with GitHub Releases or a custom update server.
- **CLI Distribution**:
  - Bundle Python core with CLI via PyInstaller or Nuitka for single-file binaries.
  - Also publish to PyPI via `uv` and `pyproject.toml`.
- **Shared Binary**:
  - Package both GUI and CLI in one binary or via CLI wrapper that invokes GUI subprocess.

------

## üé® **Design & Prototyping**

- **Figma UI Kit**:
  - Flowbite Figma Kit (Free).
  - Manually implement designs using shadcn/ui or Flowbite React components.
- **Rapid Prototyping**:
  - Use Tailwind Play or Vite + React + Tailwind dev setup.

------

## ü§ñ **AI-Friendly Development**

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use clearly structured and documented components and schemas.
  - Modular backend: CLI, settings, computation separated.
  - Use templates (Tauri + React + shadcn/ui boilerplates).
- **AI Codegen Optimization**:
  - Use `jsonschema` to generate forms.
  - Predictable settings schema supports AI-friendly generation of CLI + GUI.
  - Tauri‚Äôs config-based build system simplifies environment setup for AI agents.

------

## üì¶ **Useful Templates / Starters**

- Tauri + React + TypeScript + Tailwind boilerplates (several exist on GitHub).
- shadcn/ui with Vite + React + Zustand template.
- PyInstaller / Nuitka starter for bundling Python CLI and daemon.
