# GUI: Graphical User Interface

## GUI overview

Below, a picture of the complete GUI on macOS.

<figure>

<figcaption>The GUI of gitinspectorgui on macOS.</figcaption>
</figure>

The two main parts of the GUI are:

1.  The input part where the options are defined. This part can be scrolled up and down
    using the top scroll bar at the right.
2.  The console output part, where progress output is presented to the user while the
    repositories are analyzed. The console has its own scrollbar.

## General guidelines

There are eight input fields in the GUI where space separated patterns can be entered:

- Input folder path
- Include files: File patterns
- Extensions: File extensions to include
- Five input fields for exclusion patterns

### Multiple patterns

Multiple patterns can be entered in the input fields by separating them with commas. For
example, to include files with the extensions `java` and `py`, the pattern should be
entered as `java, py`.

### Asterisk `*`

The asterisk `*` is a wildcard character that matches zero or more characters, just like
in the shell. For example, to exclude all files with the extension `.py`, the pattern
should be entered as `*.py`.

### Case insensitivity

Matches are case insensitive, e.g. `mary` matches `Mary` and `mary`, and `John` matches
`john` and `John`.

## Top row buttons

Run Start the analysis, using the parameters given in the GUI.

Clear Clear the console, the textual output box at the bottom.

Help Prints a few lines op help output in the console.

About Opens a dialog with information about the application.

Exit Leave the GUI.

Percentage box The percentage box at the far right has small up and down triangles to
increase or decrease the maximum percentage of the height of the total GUI window that
is taken up by the input part. The console takes up the remaining percentage.

When the height of the GUI window is changed by dragging the top or bottom edges of the
window, the height of the input part is kept unchanged while dragging. When the window
height has become stable after dragging, the height of the input part is adjusted to the
percentage value.

## IO configuration

Input folder path Enter one or more comma separated folder paths in the text box, or
select one using the `Browse` button. The paths are searched for repositories.

### Input folder path is a repository

<figure>
<img src="../../assets/images/gui-repo-select.png" alt="Repository selection in the GUI">
</figure>

If the input folder path is a repository, that repository is analyzed and no search for
additional repositories takes place.

Output file path The output file path depends on the selected output prepostfix (see
next option). In the example figure, the input folder path is the path of the repository
`1dh`. Depending on the selected pre or postfix, the output file path is:

- `Postfix with repo`: `/Users/.../1-repos/grading/1dh-gitinspect`.
- `Prefix with repo`: `/Users/.../1-repos/grading/gitinspect-1dh`.
- `No prefix or postfix`: `/Users/.../1-repos/grading/gitinspect`.

Output prepostfix Select one of `Postfix with repo`, `Prefix with repo`,
`No prefix or postfix` (default).

Note that the output file is not placed inside of the repository, but in its parent
folder.

Search depth Disabled and ignored in this case.

Output file base The output filename without extension and without directories, default
`gitinspect`.

Subfolder Restrict analysis of the files of the repository to the files in this folder
and its subfolders. Remove the subfolder from the path of the files in the output.

N files Generate output for the `N` biggest files for each repository. The number of
files for which results are generated can be smaller than `N` due to files being
excluded by filters. Leave the field empty or set it to zero to show all files. Default
is 5.

File patterns Show only files matching any of the space separated patterns. When the
pattern is empty, the N largest files specified by option N files are shown.

### Input folder path is a folder but not a repository

<figure>
<img src="../../assets/images/gui-folder-select.png" alt="Folder selection in the GUI">
</figure>

If the input folder path is not a repository, all folder and subfolders up to the value
of the `Search depth` option are searched for repositories and the repositories found
are analyzed. The output file for each repository found is placed in the parent
directory of the repository.

Output file base For each repository found, the output file base is as specified for the
case `input-is-repo`.

Output file path For each repository found, the output file path is as specified for the
case `input-is-repo`.

Output prepostfix For the values `Postfix with repo` and `Prefix with repo`, the output
file path for each repository found is as specified for the case `input-is-repo`. The
value `No prefix or postfix` is disabled in this case.

Search depth Positive integer value that represents the number of levels of subfolders
that is searched for repositories, _default_ `5`.

- Search depth `0`: the input folder itself must be a repository.
- Search depth `1`: only the input folder is searched for repository folders for
  analysis.

The remaining options are as specified for the case `input-is-repo`.

## Output generation and formatting

### View options

Auto Automatically open a viewer on the analysis results. The viewer is opened after the
analysis is finished.

Dynamic blame history Automatically open a viewer on the dynamic blame history. The
viewer is opened after the analysis is finished.

### Output formats

Tick boxes `auto` and `dynamic blame history` define whether a viewer is opened on the
analysis results. The tick boxes on the line `File formats` define for which file
formats output is generated. Available output formats are `html` and `excel`. For more
information on the output formats, see `output`.

### Statistic output

These options define the columns that are shown in the output of the four first tables:
Authors, Authors-Files, Files-Authors and Files.

Show renames Show previous file names and alternative author names and emails in the
output.

Some authors use multiple names and emails in various commits. Gitinspectorgui can
detect this if there is overlap in either the name or email in author-email combinations
in commits. If show-renames is active, all names and emails of each author are shown. If
inactive, only a single name and email are shown per author.

For files that have been renamed at some point in their history, all previous names are
shown in the output.

Deletions Include a column for the number of deleted lines in the output. This does not
affect the blame output, because deleted lines cannot be shown. The default is not to
include deletions.

Scaled % For each column with output in percentages, e.g. `% Insertions`, add a column
`% Scaled insertions`, which equals the value of `% Insertions` multiplied by the number
of authors in the repository.

### Blame options

!!! note

    A blame worksheet or html blame tab shows the contents of a file and indicates for each line in the file in which commit the line was last changed, at which date and by which author. The color of the line indicates the author of the last change. The blame output is generated for each file that is analyzed.

Exclusions By means of this option, excluded blame lines can be hidden, shown or removed
from the blame output. Blame lines can be excluded for three reasons:

1.  The author of the blame line is excluded by the `Author` `Exclusion pattern`.
2.  The blame line is a comment line. By default, comment lines are excluded. They can
    be included by the option `Comments`.
3.  The blame line is an empty line. By default, empty lines are excluded. They can be
    included by the option `Empty lines`.

Values of the `Exclusions` option are:

- `hide` (default). Excluded lines are shown in the blame sheets as white, uncolored
  lines.
- `show`. Excluded lines are attributed to their author as blame lines in the color of
  the author.
- `remove`. Excluded lines are removed from the blame lines.

Copy move This option, with values from 0 to 4, affects only the Excel blame worksheets:

0.  Do not detect moved or copied lines. This means that the author that moves or copies
    a set of lines becomes the new author of the lines.
1.  Detect moved or copied lines within a file. This means that the (original) author of
    the lines that are moved or copied remains the author of the lines, independently of
    whoever copies or moves the lines. This is the default.
2.  Follow moved or copied lines across files. Consider as potential origin of a set of
    lines only files that were changed in the same commit.
3.  Same as 2, but in addition, consider as potential origin of a set of lines also the
    files of the commit that created the file containing the set of lines.
4.  Same as 3, but consider as potential origin of a set of lines also the files of all
    other commits. This can be a very expensive operation for large projects.

!!! warning

    The value of 4 for the `--copy-move` option can be extremely slow for large repositories. The values 2 and 3 can also be slow for large repositories with many commits. The default value 1 is usually fast.

For more information, see [git blame](https://www.mankier.com/1/git-blame#-M). The
option corresponds to the `-M` and `-C` options of the `git blame` command:

0.  No `-M` or `-C` options.
1.  `-M` option.
2.  `-C` option.
3.  `-C -C` options.
4.  `-C -C -C` options.

A file is considered to be a renamed or copied version of another file if they share 50%
or more lines.

The `--copy-move` option does not affect the value of insertions and deletions in the
statistics worksheets `Authors`, `Authors-Files`, `Files-Authors` and `Files`.

The problem is that even though `git log --follow`, which is used by gitinspectorgui to
calculate insertions and deletions, does detect file rename and copy operations, it does
not detect moved or copied lines. Insertions and deletions are always attributed to the
author who does the change, even if the lines are moved or copied from another file.

Blame skip Do not output html blame tabs or Excel blame sheets.

### Blame inclusions

Empty lines Include empty lines in the blame calculations. This affects the color of the
empty lines in the blame sheets. The default is not to include them and show all empty
lines in the blame sheets as white. When this setting is active, empty lines are shown
in the color of their author.

<div id="gui-comments">

Comments Include whole line comments in the blame calculations. This affects the number
of lines of each author.

The default is not to include whole line comments, which means that such lines are not
attributed to any author and are shown in the blame sheets as white. Whole line comments
are not counted in the Lines column of the statistics output, potentially causing the
sum of the Lines column to be less than the total number of lines in the file.

When this setting is active, whole line comments are shown in the color as of their
author and are counted in the Lines column of the statistics output.

A comment line is either a single or multi comment line. Only full line comments are
considered comment lines. For instance, for Python, the following line is comment line:

```python
# Start of variable declarations
```

whereas the following line is not a comment line:

```python
x = 1  # Initialize x
```

</div>

## General options

Whitespace Include whitespace changes in the statistics. This affects the statics and
the blame output. The default setting is to ignore whitespace changes.

Multithread Use multiple threads to analyze the repositories. The default is to use a
single thread.

Since Enter a date in the text box in the format YYYY-MM-DD, where leading zeros are
optional for month and day, or select one using the `.` button. Only show statistics for
commits more recent than the given date.

Until Only show statistics for commits older than the given date. See Since for the date
format.

Verbosity

- 0 (default): Show a dot for each file that is analyzed for each repository.
- 1: Show the file name instead of a dot for each analyzed file.
- 2: Show maximum debug output in the console.

Dry run

- 0: Normal analysis and output (default).
- 1: Perform all required analysis and show the output in the console, but do not write
  any output files and do not open any viewers.
- 2: Do not perform any analysis and do not produce any file or viewer output, but do
  print output lines to the console.

Extensions A comma separated list of file extensions to include when computing
statistics. The default extensions used are: c, cc, cif, cpp, glsl, h, hh, hpp, java,
js, py, rb, sql.

Specifying an asterisk `*` includes all files, regardless of extension, including files
without an extension. For more information, see the `supported`.

## Settings

Save Save all settings specified in the GUI to the currently active settings file and
print this file name to the console, see the above figure.

Save As Save the settings specified in the GUI to another file. This file becomes the
currently active settings file.

Load Open a browse dialog to select a settings file to load. This file becomes the
currently active settings file.

Reset Reset all settings to their default values and reset the location of the currently
active settings file to its default, operating system dependent, location.

Toggle Toggle the representation of the settings file between the name and the full
path.

## Exclusion patterns

Exclusion patterns are used to filter out certain elements from the analysis results.
Each exlusion pattern is a comma separated list of strings. Note that this is different
from the CLI, where the exclusion patterns are space separated.

The asterisk `*` is a wildcard character that matches zero or more characters, just like
in the shell. Exclusion patterns are used in the following fields:

Authors Filter out author names that match any of the comma separated strings in the
text box. E.g. `John Smith` excludes author `John Smith` and `John, Smith` excludes
author `John` and author `Smith`, but not author `John Fielding`. To exclude all authors
with the first name John, use `John*`.

Emails Filter out email addresses taht match any of the space separated strings in the
text box. E.g. `*@gmail.com` excludes all authors with a gmail address.

Files/Paths Filter out files that match containing any of the space separated strings in
the text box. E.g. `myfile.py test*` excludes files `myfile.py` and `testing.c`.

Revision hashes Filter out revisions that start with any of the space separated
hashes/SHAs in the text box. E.g. `8755fb, 1234567` excludes revisions that start with
`8755fb` or `1234567`.

Commit messages Filter out commit messages that match any of the space separated strings
in the text box. E.g. `bug*, fix*` excludes commits from analysis with commit messages
such as `Bugfix` or `Fixing issue #15`.
